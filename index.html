<p>Hey, what's up!</p>

<p>
  I'm Ammar, a software developer and lifelong student. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked in various roles - including iOS, backend, and infrastructure - across multiple industries. My specialty lies in designing software for a variety of use cases.
</p>

<p><strong>Why Software Engineering?</strong></p>

<p>Software engineering is the modern-day jack-of-all-trades career. There is no limit to the breadth or depth you can explore, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The size and type of companies you want to work at (startups, medium-sized, big tech, etc.)</li>
  <li>Industries you want to target (finance, healthcare, e-commerce, entertainment, and more)</li>
  <li>Areas you may want to specialize in (web, mobile, infrastructure, machine learning, computer vision, etc.)</li>
  <li>Types of software you may work on (consumer apps, enterprise systems, developer tools, etc.)</li>
  <li>Technology stacks and languages you might use (JavaScript, Java, Python, etc.)</li>
  <li>Different workstyles (in-person, remote, hybrid, night-owl)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's what makes this career so challenging, yet so rewarding</p>

  <!-- <p><strong>Why Computer Science?</strong></p>

<p>I wasn't always interested in technology. When I was young, I wanted to major in finance and work in the financial
  services industry, but much of that changed when I looked at some of the world's largest companies by market
  capitalization. Large corporations such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon as well as startups such as Tesla and
  Uber, companies that I have seen form and develop throughout my lifetime, made me realize that so much progress in
  improving the quality of life of common, everyday individuals have been the result of those who successfully created
  applications that have been engineered to work at an enormous scale. After attending Stony Brook University and
  learning about software development in the last few years, I knew I wanted to be in tech to work on complex,
  challenging problems that have real applications to the world.
