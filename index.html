<p>Hey, what's up!</p>

<p>
  My name is Ammar Chishti and I am currently a computer science student at Stony Brook University that is expected
  to graduate in the month of May of 2021. My primary interests lie in full stack web development, but other areas
  I plan to explore in the future include computer networks, distributed systems, and data science. Outside of school,
  I am deeply passionate about exercise and physical activity.
</p>

<p><strong>Why Computer Science?</strong></p>

<p>I wasn't always interested in technology. When I was young, I wanted to major in finance and work in the financial
  services industry, but much of that changed when I looked at some of the world's largest companies by market
  capitalization. Large corporations such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon as well as startups such as Tesla and
  Uber, companies that I have seen form and develop throughout my lifetime, made me realize that so much progress in
  improving the quality of life of common, everyday individuals have been the result of those who successfully created
  applications that have been engineered to work at an enormous scale. After attending Stony Brook University and
  learning about software development in the last few years, I knew I wanted to be in tech to work on complex,
  challenging problems that have real applications to the world.
