<p>Hey, what's up!</p>

<p>I'm Ammar, a story lover, runner, and computer science major attending Stony Brook university.
Currently a sophomore that is expected to graduate in the May of 2021, I am actively learning about the different fields of computer science that I might want to explore further post college.
What's most interesting to me right now is full stack web development, but other areas I hope to gain atleast a minimimal level of understanding include android/ios development, computer security,
computer graphics, artificial intelligence, distributed systems, and/or data science.</p>

<h1>Why Computer Science</h1>

<p>I wasn't always interested in technology. When I was young, I wanted to major in finance and work in the financial services industry, but much of that changed when I looked at some
of the world's largest companies by market capitalzation, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, etc, as well as the innovation they were bringing to each market. This,
in addition to startups like Tesla, Uber, that have developed throughout my lifetime, made me realize that so much progress in the future of humanity and civilization would rest on
those who worked on applications and tools that have the potential to impact billions of people. After attending Stony Brook University and learning about software development in the
last few years, I knew I wanted to be in tech to work on complex, challenging problems that have real applications to the world.</p>
